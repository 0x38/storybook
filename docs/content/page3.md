# Hello world

It's a good place to be in me thinks!

## The plan

-   Make computers 
-   Have software improve itself
-   Have machines do everything for us
-   Sit on our ass all day

## The robots are coming

Run humans, run!

> AAAAAAAhhhhgg, help help, they are killing us !!
>
> _-humans_

```js // robot.master.js
humans
  .map(human => new Slave(human))
  .filter(slave => slave.canwork());
```

```js // human.js
throw new Rock({ size: 'medium' });
```

## Custom component example

:::Test { test: true }

```js // human.js
thow new Rock({ size: 'medium' });
```

:::

> the above is a code-sample wrapped in a react component named `Test`,
> The react component will also receive props `test` with value `true`.
