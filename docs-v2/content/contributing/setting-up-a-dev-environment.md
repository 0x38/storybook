# Setting up a dev environment

## Prerequisites

Please have the **_latest_** stable versions of the following on your machine

-   node
-   yarn
-   @storybook/cli

## Initial Setup

If you run into trouble here, make sure your node, npm, and **_yarn_** are on the latest versions (yarn at least v1.0.0).

1.  `cd ~` (optional)
2.  `git clone https://github.com/storybooks/storybook.git` _bonus_: use your own fork for this step
3.  `cd storybook`
4.  `yarn`
5.  `yarn bootstrap --core`
6.  `yarn test --core`
7. `yarn dev` *You must have this running for your changes to show up*

### Bootstrapping everything

This method is slow, and if you are reading this tutorial you probably don't want to do it

1.  `yarn bootstrap`
2.  At the prompt: `a`, `enter`, `y`, `enter` ( `a` selects all (fully bootstrap) and `y` is to confirm)
3.  Have a beer üç∫
4.  `yarn test` (to verify everything worked)


## Working with the kitchen sink apps

Within the examples folder of the Storybook repo, you will find kitchen sink examples of storybook implementations for the various platforms that storybook supports.

### React and Vue

1.  DO NOT RUN `yarn` or `yarn install`
2. `yarn storybook`
3.  Verify that your local version works

### React Native (CRNA and Vanilla)

TODO: Figure out what is wrong with this

## Working with your own app

### Linking Storybook

Storybook is broken up into sub-projects that you can install as you need them. For this example we will be working with `@storybook/react`.
**Note:** You need to `yarn link` from inside the sub project you are working on **_NOT_** the storybook root directory

1.  `cd app/react`
2.  `yarn link`


### Connecting Your App To Storybook

**_Note:_** If you aren't seeing addons after linking storybook, you probably have a versioning issue which can be fixed by simply linking each addon you want to use.
This applies for the kitchen sink apps as well as your own projects.

*Make sure `yarn dev` is running*

#### 1. Setup storybook in your project

First we are going to install storyboook, then we are going to link `@storybook/react` into our project. This will replace `node_modules/@storybook/react` with a symlink to our local version of storybook. 

1.  `getstorybook`
2.  `yarn storybook`
3.  Verify that your local version works

#### 2. Link

**_Note_**: This process is the same fore `@storybook/vue`, `@storybook/addon-foo`, etc

1.  Go to your storybook _root_ directory 
2.  `yarn dev`
3.  Wait for the output to stop 
4.  Go to your storybook-sandbox-app directory
5.  `yarn link @storybook/react`
6.  `yarn storybook`


### Verify your local version is working

You should now have a working storybook dev environment up and running. To verify this you can make changes to the following file:

`open app/react/src/client/manager/preview.js`

Save and go to `http://localhost:9009` (or wherever storybook is running)

If you don't see the changes rerun `yarn storybook` again in your sandbox app
