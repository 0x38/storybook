# Setting up a dev environment (React)

This guide is here to help you get a local version of Storybook running so that you can hack on it
and contribute back to the community.

## Prerequisites

Please have the **_latest_** stable versions of the following on your machine

-   node
-   npm
-   yarn
-   create-react-app

## Setting it up

### 1.  Setup storybook locally

If you run into trouble here, make sure your node, npm, and **_yarn_** are on the latest versions.

1.  `cd ~` (optional)
2.  `git clone https://github.com/storybooks/storybook.git` _bonus_: use your own fork for this step
3.  `cd storybook`
4.  `yarn`
5.  `yarn bootstrap --core`
6.  `yarn test --core`

#### Bootstrapping everything

This method is slow, and if you are reading this tutorial you probably don't want to do it

1.  `yarn bootstrap`
2.  At the prompt: `a`, `enter`, `y`, `enter`
3.  Have a beer üç∫
4.  `yarn test`

### 2. Create a project (skip this if you already have a react project)

1.  `cd ~` (optional)
2.  `create-react-app storybook-sandbox-app`
3.  `cd storybook-sandbox-app`
4.  `yarn start`
5.  Verify that you have a working react app.

### 3. Setup storybook in your project

First we are going to install storyboook, then we are going to link `@storybook/react` into our project. This will replace `node_modules/@storybook/react` with a symlink to our local version of storybook. 

1.  `getstorybook`
2.  `yarn storybook`
3.  Verify that storybook works

### 4. Link storybook

Storybook is broken up into sub-projects that you can install as you need them. For this experiment we will be working with `@storybook/react`. 
**Note:** You need to `yarn link` from inside the sub project you are working on **_NOT_** the storybook root directory

1.  `cd app/react`
2.  `yarn link`

### 5. Get them working together

1.  Go to your storybook _root_ directory 
2.  `yarn dev`
3.  Wait for the output to stop 
4.  Go to your storybook-sandbox-app directory
5.  `yarn link @storybook/react`
6.  `yarn storybook`

### 6. Gotchas

If you don't see any addons, its probably because there is a version difference between the version of Storybook CLI you are using and the versin of storybook in your local branch. To fix this, simply follow steps 4 and 5 above with each of the addons you would like to use.

## Hacking (optional)

You should now have a working storybook dev environment up and running. To verify this you can follow the following steps from your storybook root directory.

`open app/react/src/client/manager/preview.js`

Change the render method to return

```JSX
<div>
  <h1>Hello World üòé</h1>
  <iframe
    id="storybook-preview-iframe"
    title="preview"
    style={iframeStyle}
    src={this.props.url}
    allowFullScreen
  />
</div>
```

Save and go to `http://localhost:9009` (or wherever storybook is running)

If you don't see the changes rerun `yarn storybook` again in your sandbox app
